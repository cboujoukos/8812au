8812au
======

Linux driver for Realtek 802.11ac, used in many dual-band Wifi USB dongles.

This source was [originally distributed by TP-LINK](http://www.tplink.com/be/support/download/?model=Archer+T4U&version=V1) on 2015/8/21 to be used with their [Archer T4U AC1200 Wireless Dual Band USB Adapter](http://www.tplink.com/be/products/details/?model=Archer+T4U).

I have not tested it on other 8812au devices.
